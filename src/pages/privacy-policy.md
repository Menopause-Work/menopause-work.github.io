## Introduction 

We take your privacy and the security or your personal data seriously. In this Privacy Policy we describe how we look after your personal data. By visiting and using our website you consent to the collection of personal data as described in this policy. We may update this policy from time to time. The last update was on 21 June 2023. 

## Contacting us 

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any questions about your personal data, please contact us at info@hereweare.org.uk or on our helpline: 0300 303 0500.  

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with any concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance. 

## How is your personal data collected? 

When you visit our website, we collect information about you including your IP address, the pages and even the parts of the pages you visit. We also use cookies unless you restrict the use of cookies in your browser. 

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through: 

## Direct interactions. 

You may give us your Identity, Contact and Financial Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you: 

create an account on our website; 
complete our online courses; 
request marketing to be sent to you; 
enter a promotion or survey; or 
give us feedback or contact us.


## Automated technologies or interactions. 

As you interact with our website, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies. 

## How we use your personal data 

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances: 

Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. 
Where we need to comply with a legal obligation. 


Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data although we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us. 

## Cookies 

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. 

## Third-party links 

Our websites and products may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit. 

## International transfers 

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. 

Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK. 

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK. 

## Data security 

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 

## How long will you use my personal data for? 

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. 

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. 

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 

## Your legal rights 

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including: 

Request access to your personal data. 
Request correction of your personal data.
Request erasure of your personal data. 
Object to processing of your personal data. 
Request restriction of processing your personal data. 
Request transfer of your personal data. 
Right to withdraw consent. 


If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. 

## No fee usually required 

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

## What we may need from you 

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 

## Time limit to respond 

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
